# d0pamine anti-cheat
a really old project that I've stopped working on, get ready for new paid anti-cheats lmao.

## information
the anti-cheat is mainly server-sided, it will generate the `client.lua` & `server.lua` on resource start and main parts of the code will be randomized.

## detections
global variable
load function manipulation
LoadResourceFile(attempt to grab from a different resource)
AddExplosion
server ip printing
warmenu debug trace
